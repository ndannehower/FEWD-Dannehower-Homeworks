Additional Comments:

- Good job! All the functionality is there and your javascript is well indented.

- The 'option' html you're creating isn't quite formatted correctly. You're initializing it with "<option></option>" and then appending a second set of 'option' tags. If you check the resulting HTML you'll see it looks like "<option><option>value</option></option>"
